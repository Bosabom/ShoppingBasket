# ShoppingBasket

A shopping-basket application with a .NET 9 Web API backend and a React (Vite) frontend.
The project demonstrates item catalog, discounts, receipt creation and history.
User have an opportunity to enter quantities of listed products and submit form.
After that, under the form the receipt will be generated (with list of items, their costs and discounted costs).
Receipt by itself contains auto-generated number, created date and total cost.
Also User can view history of past transactions.

## Project functionality

### Server (`ShoppingBasket.Server`)

- Exposes a minimal REST API for:
  - `GET /items` and `GET /items/{id}` — catalog of available items.
  - `GET /discounts` and `GET /discounts/{id}` — configured discounts.
  - `GET /receipts` and `GET /receipts/{id}` — receipts.
  - `GET /receipts/detailed/{id}` — receipt with ordered items expanded.
  - `GET /receipts/history` — short receipts list for history UI.
  - `POST /receipts` — create a receipt from a request with item quantities.
- Receipt creation:
  - Loads requested items, applies discounts, calculates per-line and receipt totals, and persists the receipt.
  - Supports percentage discounts (per-item) and multi-buy discounts (target item receives discount for eligible units).
- Persistence and mapping:
  - Uses Entity Framework Core with Npgsql (PostgreSQL) and applies EF migrations at startup.
  - Uses Mapster for DTO mapping to/from entities.
- Error handling:
  - Throws domain `BadRequestException` for invalid requests (e.g., all zero quantities, missing items) which the middleware maps to HTTP Problem responses.
- Tests:
  - Unit tests with `xUnit` exercise calculation logic and validation.

### Client (`shoppingbasket.client`)

- Single page React app (Vite) that:
  - Renders a `BasketForm` where users enter quantities for available items (Soup, Bread, Milk and Apples).
  - Shows available discounts inline.
  - Submits `POST /receipts` and displays the created receipt via `GeneratedReceipt` component.
  - Provides a `ReceiptsTable` page that fetches `GET /receipts/history` and lists past receipts.
- Form UX:
  - Uses `react-hook-form` for input handling and client-side validation.
  - Displays server error messages returned as problem details when receipt creation fails.
- Tests:
  - Cypress e2e tests (in `shoppingbasket.client/cypress`)
- HTTP:
  - Client uses a small `httpService` wrapper (axios) to call the API.

## Tech stack

- Backend
  - .NET 9 / C#
  - ASP.NET Core Minimal API
  - Entity Framework Core (EF Core) with Npgsql (PostgreSQL provider)
  - Mapster (object-to-object mapping)
  - xUnit (unit tests)
- Frontend
  - React (function components)
  - Vite (dev server / build)
  - react-hook-form (form handling)
  - Cypress (end-to-end tests)
  - axios — used for API calls
- Dev / tooling
  - dotnet CLI (`dotnet restore`, `dotnet build`, `dotnet run`, `dotnet test`)
  - npm / Node.js (client, Vite, Cypress)
  - Git

## Quick start

1. Server

Basic instructions to build and run the server component.

### Prerequisites

- .NET 9 SDK installed

### Run the server from the command line

1. Open a terminal and change to the server project folder:
   - `cd path/to/ShoppingBasket.Server`
2. Restore packages:
   - `dotnet restore`
3. Build the project:
   - `dotnet build`
4. Run the project:
   - `dotnet run`

Optional: start the server on fixed URLs (useful for local proxying)

- Run HTTP only:
  - `dotnet run --urls "http://localhost:5204" --project ./ShoppingBasket.Server/ShoppingBasket.Server.csproj`
- Run both HTTP and HTTPS:
  - `dotnet run --urls "https://localhost:7051;http://localhost:5204" --project ./ShoppingBasket.Server/ShoppingBasket.Server.csproj`

### Run from Visual Studio

- Open the solution, set `ShoppingBasket.Server` as the startup project and press **F5** (debug) or **Ctrl+F5** (run without debugger). You can also edit `launchSettings.json` to change the `applicationUrl` for the project profile.

### Run unit tests

- From solution or test project folder:
  - `dotnet test`

2. Client

- For front-end development, run the client separately (if it wasn't run with server) (see project README or package.json in `shoppingbasket.client`) and configure a proxy (e.g. Vite) to the server URL above if needed

1. Open a terminal and change to the server project folder:
   - `cd path/to/shoppingbasket.client`
2. Run npm install:
   - `npm install`
3. Build the project:

   - `npm run dev`

4. Integration tests (e2e)

- From solution or test project folder:
  - `npx cypress open`
  # or headless:
  - `npx cypress run`

If you run the client separately, configure a Vite proxy to forward `/receipts`, `/items`, `/discounts` to the server URL.

3. Run tests
   - Server unit tests:
     ```bash
     dotnet test
     ```
   - Client e2e (Cypress):
     ```bash
     cd shoppingbasket.client
     npx cypress open
     # or headless:
     npx cypress run
     ```

## Notes and gotchas

- Ensure your `appsettings.json` (or environment variables) contains a valid PostgreSQL connection string for EF Core migrations or create the database manually prior to startup.
- If you run the client separately, either enable CORS in the server or configure the Vite proxy to avoid cross-origin issues.
- For IDE runs, adjust `ShoppingBasket.Server/Properties/launchSettings.json` `applicationUrl` or use the `--urls` flag when running with `dotnet run`.
